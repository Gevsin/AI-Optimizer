# AI-Optimizer
![AI-Opitmizer Framework](./images/framework.png)

AI-Optimizer is a next generation of deep reinforcement learning framework, privoding rich algorithm libraries ranging from model-free to model-based RL algorithms, from single-agent to multi-agent algorithms. 

For now, AI-Optimizer privodes following facets and more libraries and implementations are comming soon.
- Model-based reinforcement learning
- Representation Learning  
- Multiagent Reinforcement learning
- Transfer Learning
- Offline Reinforcement Learning
