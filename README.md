# AI-Optimizer
AI-Optimizer is a next generation deep reinforcement learning suit, privoding rich algorithm libraries ranging from model-free to model-based RL algorithms, from single-agent to multi-agent algorithms. Moreover, AI-Optimizer contains a flexible and easy-to-use distributed training framekwork for efficient policy training.

## Repo: Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
MARL repo contains the released codes of representative research works of TJU-RL-Lab on the topic of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). The research topics are classified according to the critical challenges of MARL, e.g., the curse of dimensionality (scalability) issue, non-stationarity, multiagent credit assignment, explorationâ€“exploitation tradeoff and hybrid action. see more [here](https://github.com/TJU-DRL-LAB/MARL)
