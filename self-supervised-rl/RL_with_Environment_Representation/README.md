# RL with Environment Representation

Environment Representation is one major category in our taxonomy. 

# To update below

The core research content of environment representation is to capture the **variations of environments** from the distribution of interests.

## Repo Content

This repo contains representative research works of TJU-RL-Lab on the topic of RL with Environment Representation.



## An Overall View of Research Works in This Repo  

This repo will be constantly updated to include new researches made by TJU-RL-Lab. 
(The development of this repo is in progress at present.)

## Installation

The algorithms in this repo are all implemented **python 3.5** (and versions above). **Tensorflow 1.x** and **PyTorch** are the main DL code frameworks we adopt in this repo with different choices in different algorithms.

Note that the algorithms contained in this repo may not use all the same environments. Please check the README of specific algorithms for detailed installation guidance.

## TODO
- [ ] Update README file for PAnDR
- [ ] Tidy up code of PAnDR
- [ ] Upload code of CCM
